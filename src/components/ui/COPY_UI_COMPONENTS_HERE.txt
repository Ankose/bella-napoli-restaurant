⚠️ COPY YOUR UI FOLDER HERE ⚠️

Copy the entire "ui" folder from your VS Code project.

It should contain files like:
- button.jsx
- badge.jsx
- tabs.jsx
- dialog.jsx
- select.jsx
- checkbox.jsx
- label.jsx
- popover.jsx
- calendar.jsx
- sheet.jsx

Just drag the whole "ui" folder from VS Code into this components folder!
